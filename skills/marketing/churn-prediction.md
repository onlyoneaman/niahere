The best save happens before the customer ever clicks "Cancel."

## Risk Signals

Track these leading indicators of churn:

| Signal | Risk Level | Timeframe |
|--------|-----------|-----------|

| Key feature usage stops | High | 1-3 weeks before cancel |
| Support tickets spike then stop | High | 1-2 weeks before cancel |
| Email open rates decline | Medium | 2-6 weeks before cancel |
| Billing page visits increase | High | Days before cancel |

## Health Score Model

Build a simple health score (0-100) from weighted signals:

```
Health Score = (
  Login frequency score × 0.30 +
  Feature usage score   × 0.25 +
  Support sentiment     × 0.15 +
  Billing health        × 0.15 +
  Engagement score      × 0.15
)
```

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Healthy | Upsell opportunities |
| 60-79 | Needs attention | Proactive check-in |
| 40-59 | At risk | Intervention campaign |
| 0-39 | Critical | Personal outreach |
